The primary aim was to produce an emotional detection prototype using IoT to distract users from doom-scrolling when it recognized a user had a sad face. However, the idea was rejected by HU University due to the lack of evidence to support the idea that most people doing doomscorrling have sad faces.
### <h3 align="left">How does it work</h3>
---
This prototype is built with p5js and Arduino and uses a servo motor to react based on emotion detection.
